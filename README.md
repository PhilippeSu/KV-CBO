Description
-----------
MATLAB Implementation of the Kuramoto-Vicsek Consensus-Based Optimization (KV-CBO) method.

For the readers convenience we have included the following test files:

#### Ackley and Rastrigin ####
- Test_KV_CBO_3D.m,
- Test_KV_CBO_MD.m,

#### Robust Subspace Detection and Eigenfaces ####
- Test_subspace_detection.m,
- Test_subspace_detection_3D.m,
- Test_eigenfaces.m,

Test_eigenfaces.m requires the pictures to be saved columnwise in a text file Faces.txt, where the field separator is ','.

#### Phase Retrieval ####
- Test_phase_retrieval.m.
