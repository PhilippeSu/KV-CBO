## Description

This is a MATLAB implementation of the KV-CBO (Kuramoto-Vicsek Consensus-based Optimization) method.

### v1

* The folder v1 contains the original implementation of the KV-CBO method with isotropic noise, and test files for robust subspace detection, phase retrieval and, further, Ackley and Rastrigin function. 

### v2

* In v2 we have added an implementation of KV-CBO with anisotropic (componentwise) noise, and the following test functions: Solomon, Griewank, Alpine, XSY random, maximum Eigenvalue.

### PhD

* In PhD we included the code and tests from the dissertation "Analysis of a Consensus-based Optimization Method on Hypersurfaces and Applications" (2023) published online at https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/?id=1647263
